# Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

## Adapter 

Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

## Bridge

Split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

## Composite

Compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

## Decorator

Attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

## Facade 

Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

# Flyweight

Allows programs to support vast quantities of objects by keeping their memory consumption low. The pattern achieves it by sharing parts of object state between multiple objects.

## Proxy

Provides a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
